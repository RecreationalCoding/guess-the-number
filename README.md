# Guess The Number Game in Various Programming Languages
This is a repository containing code for **Guess The Number** game written in various programming languages.

 You can find the video of the coding session for each language in [this Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEaeUldl2i2n4hif3dfPvdKd_dQhlv15e) of the [Recreational Coding YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3IBCf86TZGMk0us0dzYkOA).

Here are the language agnostic steps that are followed in every language used:
```
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
2. Set the number of guesses to 0
3. Print "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100."
4. Print "Take a guess: "
5. Read in the user's guess
6. Increment the number of guesses
7. If the user's guess is correct:
    - Print "You guessed it! The number was X."
    - Print "You guessed it in Y attempts."
8. If the user's guess is too low, print "Your guess is too low."
9. If the user's guess is too high, print "Your guess is too high."
